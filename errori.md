# Errori in git

## Errore: "tip of your current branch is behind"

What causes ”tip of your current branch is behind”?

Git works with the concept of local and remote branches. 

A local branch is a branch that exists in your local version of the git repository. 

A remote branch is one that exists on the remote location (most repositories usually have a remote called origin).

“the tip of your current branch is behind its remote counterpart” means that there have been changes on the remote branch that you don’t have locally.

2 types of changes to the remote branch: someone added commits or someone modified the history of the branch.

## Soluzioni

### Soluzione 1

Merge the remote branch into local

`git pull`

Se non funziona e non mi interessa l'origin:

### Soluzione 2: cancello l'origin (locale)

Warning: this is a destructive action, it overwrites all the changes in your local branch with the changes from the remote

`git reset --hard origin/master`

### Soluzione 3: salvo le modifiche locali da qualche parte (git stash o un'altro branch) e poi ripristino

Remote rebase + local commits: 

1. soft git reset

2. stash 

3. “hard pull”

4. pop stash

5. commit


#### 1. Soft reset

##### Opzione 1
The first commit you’ve added has sha `<first-commit-sha>`use:

Note the ^ which means the commit preceding `<first-commit-sha>`

`git reset <first-commit-sha>^ .`

##### Opzione 2

If you know the number of commits you’ve added you replace 3 with the number of commits you want to “undo”:

`git reset HEAD~3 .`

You should now be able to run git status and see un-staged (ie. “modified”) file changes from the local commits we’ve just “undone”.

#### 2. Save your changes to the stash

Run git stash to save them to the stash.

If you run git status you’ll see the un-staged (“modified”) files aren’t there any more.

#### 2. Hard pull

Run the hard pull as seen in the previous section

Run git reset --hard origin/branch-name as seen in 2.

#### 3. pop stash

Un-stash and re-commit your changes

To restore the stashed changes:

`git stash pop`

#### 4. Commit

You can now use git add (hopefully with the -p option, eg. git add -p .) followed by git commit to add your local changes to a branch that the remote won’t reject on push.

Once you’ve added your changes, git push shouldn’t get rejected.

### Soluzione 4: branch off of the local branch, and re-apply the commits of a “hard pull”-ed version of the branch

4. Remote rebase + local commits 2: checkout to a new temp branch, “hard pull” the original branch, cherry-pick from temp onto branch
That alternative to using stash is to branch off of the local branch, and re-apply the commits of a “hard pull”-ed version of the branch.

Create a new temp branch
To start with we’ll create a new temporary local branch. Assuming we started on branch branch-name branch (if not, run git checkout branch-name) we can do:

git checkout -b temp-branch-name
This will create a new branch temp-branch-name which is a copy of our changes but in a new branch

Go back to the branch and “hard pull”
We’ll now go back to branch branch-name and overwrite our local version with the remote one:

git checkout branch-name
Followed by git reset --hard origin/branch-name as seen in 2.

Cherry-pick the commits from temp branch onto the local branch
We’ll now want to switch back to temp-branch-name and get the SHAs of the commits we want to apply:

git checkout temp-branch-name
Followed by

git log
To see which commits we want to apply (to exit git log you can use q).

Cherry-pick each commit individually
Say we want to apply commits <commit-sha-1> and <commit-sha-2>.

We’ll switch to the branch that has been reset to the remote version using:

git checkout branch-name
We’ll then use cherry-pick (see cherry-pick git docs) to apply those commits:

git cherry-pick <commit-sha1> && git cherry-pick <commit-sha2>
Cherry-pick a range of commits
If you’ve got a bunch of commits and they’re sequential, you can use the following (for git 1.7.2+)

We’ll make sure to be on the branch that has been reset to the remote version using:

git checkout branch-name
For git version 1.7.2+, credit to François Marier in “Cherry-picking a range of git commits” - Feeding the Cloud

git cherry-pick <first-commit-sha>^..<last-commit-sha>
You should now be able to git push the local branch to the remote without getting rejected.
